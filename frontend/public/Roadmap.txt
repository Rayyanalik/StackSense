AI-Powered Tech Stack Recommender – Enhanced Project Roadmap
PHASE 1: Data Collection & Preparation (Week 1–2)
Step 1: Curate & Automate Real-World Project Examples [Improved]

Start with a small dataset (100–200 projects) for rapid iteration.

[Improved]: Automate data collection using public APIs (GitHub, StackShare, Product Hunt).

Format each project as:

json
{
  "title": "AI Chatbot",
  "description": "A chatbot that answers customer support queries for e-commerce.",
  "domain": "AI, Web, Customer Support",
  "tech_stack": ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB", "Dialogflow", "AWS Lambda"]
}
[Improved]: Schedule periodic data refreshes to keep recommendations up-to-date.

Step 2: Data Validation, Cleaning & Enrichment [Improved]

Use numpy and pandas for data cleaning and validation.

Implement data quality checks:

Check for missing values

Validate tech stack names

Ensure consistent formatting

[Improved]: Normalize tech stack names, tokenize and lemmatize descriptions using spaCy or NLTK.

[Improved]: Use topic modeling (e.g., LDA) or entity recognition to enrich domain categorization.

[Improved]: Add user feedback loop for data correction and enrichment.

PHASE 2: MVP Build (Week 2–3)
Step 3: Modular & Documented Development Environment [Improved]

Install required packages:

Backend: fastapi, uvicorn, sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, openai, python-dotenv, pandas, spaCy

Frontend: React with TypeScript, Material-UI, Axios, React Query

Set up version control with Git.

[Improved]: Use clear modular folder structure (separate modules for embeddings, retrieval, LLM integration).

[Improved]: Add a README and architecture diagram for onboarding and documentation.

Step 4: Build Accessible, Responsive Frontend [Improved]

Use Material-UI for a modern, dark-themed, accessible UI.

Implement components:

Project description form

Recommendation display

Similar projects list

Loading states and error handling

Add TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

Implement React Query for data fetching.

[Improved]: Ensure ARIA accessibility and keyboard navigation.

[Improved]: Plan for internationalization (i18n) if needed.

Step 5: Implement Modular Backend API [Improved]

Set up FastAPI application with CORS.

Create API endpoints:

POST /api/recommend for tech stack recommendations

GET /health for health checks

Implement data models using Pydantic.

[Improved]: Modularize business logic (embeddings, retrieval, LLM) for easier upgrades.

Set up environment variables for API keys.

PHASE 3: ML & NLP Integration (Week 4–6)
Step 6: Feature Engineering & Embeddings [Improved]

Use SentenceTransformers to embed project descriptions.

Implement data preprocessing pipeline (including lemmatization, stopword removal).

Compute cosine similarity between user input and stored projects.

[Improved]: Track and log embedding quality metrics.

Step 7: Efficient Similar Project Retrieval [Improved]

Use FAISS for efficient vector storage.

Implement top-N similar project retrieval.

[Improved]: Consider optional managed vector DB (e.g., Pinecone free tier) for future scaling.

Add error handling for edge cases.

[Improved]: Log retrieval performance and monitor for drift.

Step 8: LLM Integration (GPT-3.5 Turbo) [Improved]

Set up OpenAI API integration.

Implement prompt engineering for:

Tech stack recommendations

Explanation generation

Best practices suggestions

Add caching for common queries.

Implement rate limiting and error handling.

[Improved]: Add fallback to open-source LLMs (e.g., Ollama) if API quota is exceeded.

[Improved]: Log LLM output for quality monitoring and improvement.

Step 9: Recommendation Engine with Feedback Loop [Improved]

Combine similarity-based results with LLM insights.

Implement confidence scoring.

Add explanation generation.

Include best practices and alternatives.

[Improved]: Allow users to rate recommendations; use feedback to refine engine.

Add validation for recommended stacks.

PHASE 4: Testing, Monitoring & Deployment (Week 7–8)
Step 10: Testing, QA & Continuous Improvement [Improved]

Write unit tests for core functionality.

Implement integration and E2E tests (e.g., with Playwright or Cypress).

Add input validation tests.

[Improved]: Set up automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Vercel).

[Improved]: Monitor API usage, latency, and errors with free tools.

Step 11: Frontend Polish & Accessibility [Improved]

Add project history feature.

Implement export to README functionality.

Enhance UI/UX with better error messages.

Add loading states and progress indicators.

[Improved]: Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Step 12: Free & Scalable Deployment [Improved]

Deploy backend on Render/Heroku free tier or containerize with Docker.

Deploy frontend on Vercel/Netlify free tier.

Set up CI/CD pipeline.

Add basic monitoring (e.g., Vercel analytics, logging).

Create deployment documentation.

BONUS PHASE (Optional, as resources allow)
Add user authentication (Supabase Auth or Auth0 free tier).

Implement project saving and sharing.

Add stack comparison feature.

Create a REST API version using FastAPI.

Add analytics dashboard (e.g., with free-tier Metabase).

[Improved]: Plan for modular upgrades and microservices if scaling is needed.

Development Guidelines (Updated)
Use Git for version control.

Write clear documentation and onboarding guides.

Implement proper error handling and logging.

Follow PEP 8 for Python and ESLint for TypeScript.

Write unit and E2E tests for critical functionality.

Use type hints and TypeScript for maintainability.

Secure API keys and sensitive data.

Monitor API rate limits and set up alerts.

Ensure accessibility and internationalization.

Schedule regular roadmap reviews and user feedback sessions for continuous improvement.
